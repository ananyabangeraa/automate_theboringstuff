# automate_theboringstuff
A repository of beginner and intermediate python codes to improve everyday tasks. This repo will serve as an everyday document of my personal python projects throughout 2021-22 as well as a personal suggestion/experience guide. I'm trying to start a habit of coding everyday with the goal of utilising python's vast potential to build a variety of applications!
